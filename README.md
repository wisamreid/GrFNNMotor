    Brain oscillations are of functional relevance to the healthy
    functioning of the brain. In the motor system, desynchronization of
    oscillatory activity in the beta band ( 20Hz) is observed through
    periodic somatosensory and/or auditory stimulation. This
    desynchronization occurs at a rate equal to the period of stimulation,
    and resynchronization of oscillatory activity anticipates the next
    stimulus. The computations underlying motor function can be explained by
    networks of neural oscillators carrying out non-linear transformations
    of stimuli, reflected by desynchronization of oscillatory activity in
    the motor system. We developed a neural model of nonlinear oscillators
    that transforms stimuli into characteristic oscillatory activity of the
    beta band. Our model is built using a canonical model of nonlinear
    oscillators, captures even-related desynchronization in the beta band,
    and is able to anticipate the next period of stimulation through
    resynchronization. Additionally, our model provides a dynamical-systems
    perspective of computations and stimuli transformations in the motor
    system.
