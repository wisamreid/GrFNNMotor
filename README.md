### abstract: 

Brain oscillations are of functional relevance to the healthy
functioning of the brain. In the motor system, desynchronization of
oscillatory activity in the beta band (Â 20Hz) is observed through
periodic somatosensory and/or auditory stimulation. This
desynchronization occurs at a rate equal to the period of stimulation,
and resynchronization of oscillatory activity anticipates the next
stimulus. The computations underlying motor function can be explained by
networks of neural oscillators carrying out non-linear transformations
of stimuli, reflected by desynchronization of oscillatory activity in
the motor system. We developed a neural model of nonlinear oscillators
that transforms stimuli into characteristic oscillatory activity of the
beta band. Our model is built using a canonical model of nonlinear
oscillators, captures even-related desynchronization in the beta band,
and is able to anticipate the next period of stimulation through
resynchronization. Additionally, our model provides a dynamical-systems
perspective of computations and stimuli transformations in the motor system.
